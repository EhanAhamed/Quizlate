## The Idea

Quizlet is epic, but it's not free or open source. Kahoot is epic, but it's also not free or open source. Gimkit, Blooket, Quizziz, the list goes on.

What if there was a better, open source study tool that has everything these various study tools have?

That's what Studyapp is: A free, open source, studying tool with flashcards, review games, & more

### The cool part - Open source 

Quizlet has flashcards and individual practice, Kahoot is a review game, but the problem is if a teacher makes an entire "study set" in one program, there is no easy way to port it to another.

Since Studyapp is open source
